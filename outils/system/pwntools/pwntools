pwntools - CTF toolkit
Pwntools is a CTF framework and exploit development library. Written in Python, it is designed for rapid prototyping and development, and intended to make exploit writing as simple as possible.

from pwn import *
context(arch = 'i386', os = 'linux')
r = remote('exploitme.example.com', 31337)
# EXPLOIT CODE GOES HERE
r.send(asm(shellcraft.sh()))
r.interactive()
Documentation
Our documentation is available at https://docs.pwntools.com/

A series of tutorials is also https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools-tutorial#readme

To get you started, weâ€™ve provided some example solutions for past CTF challenges in our https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools-write-ups.

Installation
Pwntools is best supported on 64-bit Ubuntu LTS releases (14.04, 16.04, 18.04, and 20.04). Most functionality should work on any Posix-like distribution (Debian, Arch, FreeBSD, OSX, etc.).

Python3 is suggested, but Pwntools still works with Python 2.7. Most of the functionality of pwntools is self-contained and Python-only. You should be able to get running quickly with

apt-get update
apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-dev git libssl-dev libffi-dev build-essential
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pwntools
However, some of the features (assembling/disassembling foreign architectures) require non-Python dependencies. For more information, see the https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/install.html.
