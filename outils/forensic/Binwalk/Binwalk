Binwalk
Binwalk is a fast, easy to use tool for analyzing, reverse engineering, and extracting firmware images.

Python 2.7 Deprecation Notice
Even though many major Linux distros are still shipping Python 2.7 as the default interpreter in their currently stable release, we are making the difficult decision to move binwalk support exclusively to Python 3. This is likely to make many upset and others rejoice. If you need to install binwalk into a Python 2.7 environment we will be creating a tag
python27
that will be a snapshot of
master
before all of these major changes are made. Thank you for being patient with us through this transition process.

Binwalk Professional Edition
After years of developing and supporting binwalk as an open source project we have finally sold out to the man and released a cloud-based firmware extraction engine called Binwalk Enterprise. After all someone needs to pay devttys0 so he can buy more milling equipment and feed his children (in that order). Please consider subscribing and reap the benefits of getting actual customer support for all your firmware extraction and analysis needs. Please visit https://www.refirmlabs.com/binwalk-enterprise/ for more information.
