File hashes
I’m testing a mechanism for verifying the integrity of my code downloaded from GitHub by storing the file hashes in my DNS zone. This has the advantage of preventing (or lessening the chance of) an attacker being able to modify the code and also modify the corresponding hashes.

To get the SHA256 hash for the zip download file (I’m only doing the zip downloads at the moment, because I have to enter all of this information manually), issue a DNS request for the TXT record .sha256.malwaremusings.com.

For instance, to obtain the SHA256 hash for unpacker-master.zip, issue a DNS TXT record request for unpacker-master.sha256.malwaremusings.com.
